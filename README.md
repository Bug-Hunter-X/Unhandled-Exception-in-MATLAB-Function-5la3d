# Unhandled Exception in MATLAB Function

This repository demonstrates a common error in MATLAB programming: unhandled exceptions within functions.  The `bug.m` file contains a function with a flaw in its error handling.  The `bugSolution.m` file provides a corrected version.

The bug involves incomplete handling of possible input values, which may lead to unexpected results or program termination.

The solution adds more robust error checking and handling to prevent such issues and ensure the function behaves as expected for all valid and invalid inputs.
